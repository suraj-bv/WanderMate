# 🌍 WanderMate

**Travel Companion Matching** — Find your perfect travel partner. Think _Tinder meets Airbnb_ for co-travelers.

Users create profiles with personal preferences (budget style, diet, languages, travel vibe), post upcoming trips, and get matched with compatible travelers through a real-time compatibility scoring algorithm. Matched users can chat in real-time and plan their adventure together.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- A **Clerk** account — [dashboard.clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
- A **Convex** account — [dashboard.convex.dev](https://dashboard.convex.dev)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment (Local)

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
# Clerk (must be from the same Clerk app instance)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_or_pk_live_xxx

# Convex client URL (from Convex dashboard deployment settings)
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
```

### 3. Configure Convex Auth Provider Domain

Set Clerk Frontend API domain in `convex/auth.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  providers: [
    {
      domain: "https://clerk.wandermate.surajbv.me",
      applicationID: "convex",
    },
  ],
};
```

Important:

- Use the Clerk Frontend API domain format for production: `https://clerk.<your-domain>`.
- Keep this aligned with the Clerk app used by `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.

### 4. Initialize Convex (Run from Project Root)

Run this from the project root (the folder containing `package.json`):

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This generates Convex files and links your local workspace to a deployment.

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 6. Production Setup (Vercel + Clerk + Convex)

Set these in Vercel Environment Variables:

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-prod-deployment.convex.cloud
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=prod:your-prod-deployment-name
```

Clerk dashboard checklist:

- Domains verified:
  - Frontend API: `clerk.wandermate.surajbv.me`
  - Account portal: `accounts.wandermate.surajbv.me`
- Convex integration is enabled for the same Clerk app as the Vercel publishable key.

Convex deployment steps:

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

Then redeploy on Vercel so all environment changes take effect.

### 7. Troubleshooting (Common Issues)

- Error: `No CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT set`
  - Run Convex commands from project root, not the `convex/` subfolder.
  - Re-run `npx convex dev` from root to link deployment.

- Error: `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` for Clerk script URL
  - Usually a custom-domain DNS mismatch in Clerk.
  - Confirm Clerk host resolves and matches your configured custom domains.

- Error: `link_domain must be included`
  - This happens when satellite configuration is enabled but incomplete.
  - In this repo's default setup, avoid satellite env vars unless you intentionally need multi-domain auth.

- Error: `POST .../tokens/convex 404`
  - Convex integration not enabled in Clerk app, or wrong publishable key/app mismatch.
  - Verify Clerk app and Vercel key belong to the same instance.
